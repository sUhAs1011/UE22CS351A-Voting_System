# Voting_System

My fifth sem mini-project in the subject DBMS(Database Management System) which is basically electronic voting system, where our team has used python and sql(structured query language) as the main tools.The python file which file.py establishes a connection mysql using the module mysql.connector.

Our project utilises all sort of crud operations which are basically DML(data manipulation language) commands.In this electrnoic voting system there are five different components which are:

#SignUp
basically in signup a voter registers for the process of voting which he can cast during the election time

#Login
This is the portal where the voter enters all the essential details for the voting the candidate he wants during the elction period

#partyregsitration
This helps the candidate who is contesting in the election to register his/her party and if the party has already register then the another candidate from that party cannot register himself/herself

#View result
It helps in displaying the final election results

#Leave
This Leave helps you in leaving the portal
